# CircleRush Clone

There is a red ball in the game and the ball moves right and left automatically. As you press the screen, the direction of the ball changes. Random squares of two different colors fall from above. We try to get the squares that are the same color as the ball. Our score increases as we get each square of the same color. When you get the square of a different color, the game is over.
